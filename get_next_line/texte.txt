2. Initialized Data Segment: Initialized data segment, usually called simply the Data Segment. A data segment is a portion of the virtual address space of a program, which contains the global variables and static variables that are initialized by the programmer.
Note that, the data segment is not read-only, since the values of the variables can be altered at run time.
This segment can be further classified into the initialized read-only area and the initialized read-write area.
For instance, the global string defined by char s[] = “hello world” in C and a C statement like int debug=1 outside the main (i.e. global) would be stored in the initialized read-write area. And a global C statement like const char* string = “hello world” makes the string literal “hello world” to be stored in the initialized read-only area and the character pointer variable string in the initialized read-write area.
Ex: static int i = 10 will be stored in the data segment and global int i = 10 will also be stored in data segment
